## myToko - Object-Oriented Programming Project
This repository contains the myToko project, developed as part of a college assignment focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The application simulates a simple e-commerce or inventory management system, demonstrating core OOP concepts and database interaction using Java and SQL.

## Introduction

`myToko` is a console-based application designed to manage product inventory or simulate basic e-commerce operations. It leverages Object-Oriented Programming paradigms to structure the code logically and efficiently, interacting with a relational database to persist data.

## Features

* **Product Management**: Add, view, update, and delete products.

* **Inventory Tracking**: Keep track of product stock.

* **User Management**: Basic user authentication or management.

* **Database Integration**: Persistent storage of application data.

## Technologies Used

* **Apache NetBeans**: The application used to create this project.

* **Java**: The core programming language.

* **SQL**: For database management and queries.

* **JDBC** (Java Database Connectivity): For connecting Java application to the SQL database.
